# Instructions for running plot1-4 #
The plot#.R files will use the common plotdata.R to setup the data subset for the 1st. and 2nd. of February 2007. The plot data will look for hhousehold_power_consumption.txt. If this file is not found, the prepareData function will download the zip file and extract the contents on the fly. 

To run any of the plot#.R files, set working directory to the directory where the plot#.R files exists.
